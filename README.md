# pomodoro-app

This productivity app is created based on the Pomodoro technique, in which you work for a 25-minute focus interval (aka "pomodoro") then take either a 5-minute short break or, after 4 pomodoros, a 15-minute long break.

APP FEATURES:
- **Customizable settings:** change the duration of focus and break intervals to fit your needs; adjust the frequency of long breaks; turn the "time's up" ringtone on or off
- **Study music:** toggle between multiple Spotify playlists if you like listening to music while working
